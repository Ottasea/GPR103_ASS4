Tutorials
The Weekly Coder - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CJuvawxWkB_sDAS9cgktw
Helped me understand some concepts with scene construction and also provided the building blocks for the collision detection used in the game 
when I began to have issues with the rigidbody colliders not differentiating betweenthe water and the log. Watched the tutorial assuming they would 
have the answer but instead found an entirely new way to do it, which I then modified.

Class Tutorial - The vehicle script is using the initial vehicle loop sequence we learned in class but then I modified it to be used on a timer

Brackeys Tutorials - https://www.youtube.com/user/Brackeys
Watched a few of the youtube videos throughout coding the assignment to help understand certain coding practices

Changelog -
All meaningful changes had details placed in the comment box when I committed them, otherwise changes were usually me cleaning up scripts etc.
